### Bonus features added :
- Keeping Scores
  - Created a constant variable to keep playing until either player reached that score
- Lizard and Spock ('Spock' appropriately uppercased in display, but allows case insensitive user input)
- Implemented class for each move, but reverted back to only one class for move
- Keep track of a history of moves (not displayed)
- Computer personalities
  - Decided to just have methods in Computer class based on computer name, instead of multiple classes for each computer type
    - I think the logic would still be the same and would just introduce unnecessary classes like the case for separate Move subclasses above

### User input instructions :
- Enter your name
- Yes or no questions are answered by single letter 'Y', 'N', case insensitive
- Moves are input by exact moves display on screen, case insensitive
